   - HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**, and it is the standard language for creating web pages.

2. **Explain the basic structure of an HTML document.**
   - An HTML document has a basic structure as follows:
   
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
       <head>
         <title>Page Title</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
         <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
       </body>
     </html>
     ```

3. **What are HTML tags? Give examples of some common HTML tags.**
   - HTML tags are used to define elements on a web page. Common tags include:
     - `<p>` for paragraphs
     - `<a>` for links
     - `<img>` for images
     - `<ul>` for unordered lists
     - `<li>` for list items

4. **Differentiate between HTML and HTML5.**
   - HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and introduced new features like semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, etc.), video and audio elements (`<video>`, `<audio>`), and improved form controls.

5. **What is the purpose of the `<DOCTYPE>` declaration in HTML documents?**
   - The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines the document type and version. In HTML5, it's simply `<!DOCTYPE html>` and helps browsers render the page correctly.

6. **How do you create comments in HTML?**
   - HTML comments are created using `<!-- comment text -->`. They don't appear on the web page but can be helpful for documentation or notes.

    ```

52. **Explain the difference between placing the `<script>` tag in the `<head>` and at the end of the `<body>` in HTML documents.**
    - Placing `<script>` in the `<head>` loads the script before rendering, potentially delaying page display.
    - Placing it at the end of `<body>` ensures the page renders first, then loads the script, improving perceived performance.

53. **What is event delegation, and how can it be useful in web development?**
    - Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a common ancestor element of multiple child elements. It's useful for handling events efficiently, especially for dynamically generated content.

54. **How do you access and manipulate HTML elements with JavaScript? Provide examples.**
    - Use methods like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll` to access elements, and manipulate them using properties like `innerHTML` or `textContent`.

    ```javascript
    // Access by ID
    const element = document.getElementById('my-element');

    // Access by CSS selector
    const paragraph = document.querySelector('p');

    // Manipulate content
    element.innerHTML = 'New content';
    paragraph.textContent = 'Updated text';
    ```

55. **Explain the concept of event propagation in JavaScript and how it relates to HTML elements.**
    - Event propagation has two phases: capturing phase and bubbling phase. It determines the order in which event handlers are executed when an event occurs on a nested element.

    ```html
    <div id="parent">
      <button id="child">Click me</button>
    </div>
    ```

    ```javascript
    const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
    const child = document.getElementById('child');

    parent.addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Parent clicked');
    }, true); // UseCapture set to true for capturing phase

    child.addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Child clicked');
    });
    ```
